                            <b class="c-text-green">Answer</b>: The student assistants are provided based on individual student profiles of needs that are submitted to districts for approval.

                            Schools submit individual student applications to district offices.

                            Districts assign student assistant hours to schools based on the number of students approved, the severity of the needs and the schoolâ€™s special education teacher allocation.

                            Student assistants are provided to school districts to support teachers in meeting the physical, personal care and behaviour management needs of students with severe needs.

                            <b class="c-text-green">Answer</b>:
                            These names are often interchangeable. Typically, though, student affairs offices emphasize student learning and development by providing tutors, mentors, and career services. Student services offices, by contrast, may focus more on providing support to remove personal, physical, and financial barriers to help learners reach their academic goals.
